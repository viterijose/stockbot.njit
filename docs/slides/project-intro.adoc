== Goals

image::laptop-coding.jpg[background]

The project is designed to give you an as close to real-world experience as
possible. You will be making a custom web application to meet a business need.
It is highly recommended that you either pick something that would be useful
at you current job or pick something that you are interested in. This will help
you maintain focus and make sure that you have the domain specific knowledge
needed.

== Example 1

I will design a web application for approving and keeping track of field trips.
Educators will have a view where they can submit a field trip, administrators
will have a view where they can approve field trips, and there will be a public
view that shows what field trips are coming up and where they are going.

== Example 2

I will design a web application for keeping track of student discipline
referrals. It will have a teacher view for submitting the referral, it will
have a disciplinarian view for viewing the referral and adding a disposition,
and it will have a report generator for creating monthly discipline reports for
school board meetings.

== Project Proposal

* An agreement as to the requirements of the project
* Once you have submitted an idea, it will be reviewed and deliverables will be
  assigned.
* Your initial proposal may be walked-back if it is too ambitious for the time
  frame or deliverables may be added if it is too basic.
* The proposal itself is ungraded.

== Timeline

* Your project is due on the day of the final
* _Do not_ fall behind!
* We will be covering the topics needed to complete your project and the topics
  we cover may shift depending on peoples' Project Proposals.
* I will try to take class time to periodically check in, but feel free to
  bring it up in class or reach out during office hours.
