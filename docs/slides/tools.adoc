= Tools Used in Modern Web Development

== Text Editor Requirements

* Translate tab keystrokes into spaces.
* Adjust tab spacing.
* Increase/decrease the indentation level of a block
* Cut/Copy/Paste
* Convert between DOS/UNIX line endings.
** *UNIX: lines end with '\n'*
** DOS: lines end with '\r\n'

* vi is almost always installed on any *NIX/BSD system.
* You can also find versions for Windows.
* It runs in the terminal
* https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200[
The learning curve is steep].

=== https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]

* vscode is more akin to a modern IDE
* rapidly gaining more adoption and is certainly worth checking out

=== https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/[Notepad{plus}{plus}]

* popular Windows GUI text editor
* starts quickly, and many things work right out of the box.
* if you want something like notepad, but a little more versatile, then this is
  for you.

=== https://macromates.com/[TextMate]

* popular MacOS GUI text editor
* simple to get started, but offers the advanced features you may need as you
  progress.

== Version Control

* Version control tracks changes to a group of files.
* Teams can use version control to cooperatively change a group of files and
  revert to a previous state if needed.

=== Version Control: Example 1

You are working on a project for your CS101 class and you need to write a
Python program that plays tic-tac-toe. It must support player-vs-computer
_and_ player-vs-player. It's due in two days. On the first day you write the
initial code and implement player-vs-player. It works great and you fall asleep
knowing tomorrow you will finish it and turn it in on time. The next morning
you update it to support player-vs-computer and _everything_ stops working.
What do you do now? 

=== Version Control: Example 2

You are working working with a team of people to implement a complex system
that utilizes several files in several different directories. How do you make
sure everyone has the most up-to-date version of the files? What happens if two
people work on the same file at the same time?

[.columns]
=== git

.*Windows*
[.column]
* https://gitforwindows.org/[git for windows]: Installs git, git BASH, and a
GUI. The git command can then be run from PowerShell, CMD, or the BASH shell
(which it installs).

.*Mac*
[.column]
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/[git for Mac Installer]:
  Provides an easy installer for git on MacOS. 
* https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode]: Xcode installs a command line git
  and you may have it installed already. 

== https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django]

* The most popular modern web framework
* Uses Python
* Combines front end and back end development to meet the needs of most
  moderately sized web applications
* Includes a bunch of things designed to make your life easier

=== https://djangobook.com/mdj2-django-admin/[Django Features: Built-in Admin Inteface]

* Databases need to be populated with data
* User information needs to be stored and edited
* These types of interfaces are usually only used by one or two people and
  are typically the developers last thought
* Django ships with a default one that works pretty well

=== https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_orm/[Django Features: ORM]

* Translating from database responses to useful objects is sometimes an odious
  task
* Object Relational Mappings (ORM) do this automatically
* You still need to know how to formulate queries and make a database
* You can still see the SQL behind it all

== Docker

image::docker.png[width=25%]

* Web servers usually run Linux
* Web frameworks are usually made for Linux
* https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/operating-systems-market-share/[Linux is used
  on 1.63% of Desktops]
* How do we create a Linux environment on our desktop? Containers.

=== What is a Container? (Briefly)

[plantuml, container]
....
@startuml
rectangle host [
    <b>Host OS
    ---
    Windows
    MacOS
]
rectangle vm [
    <b>Virtual Machine Running Linux
    ---
    Hyper-V
    VirtualBox
    HyperKit
]
rectangle docker as "Docker"
rectangle container1 as "Container 1"
rectangle container2 as "Container 2"
rectangle container3 as "Container 3"

host --> vm
vm --> docker
docker --> container1
docker --> container2
docker --> container3

=== Docker Options

.*Docker Toolbox*
[.column]
* legacy solution
* uses VirtualBox
* comes with its own terminal: Docker Quickstart Terminal
* runs on everything

.*Docker Desktop*
[.column]
* modern solution
* uses native virtualization
* uses native terminal: PowerShell or Terminal
* runs on most modern OS

=== Common Docker Problems
Windows Home doesn't have HyperV by default::
    https://ist.njit.edu/software-available-download/#w[Upgrade to Windows 10
    Education]
VT-x isn't enabled or BIOS support isn't enabled::
    Boot into the BIOS and enable VT-x (usually under virtualization)
It says I don't have privileges::
    Run as admin

=== Common Docker Problems
Where is Docker?::
    The docker command should be run from a terminal
It worked yesterday, but now my containers aren't behaving::
    Restart Docker (typically from the task bar)
